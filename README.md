# Life Expectancy Analysis: A Global Perspective
> Examine global life expectancy trends and the factors influencing longevity. We explore the impact of health interventions and economic conditions on mortality rates, using data from 193 countries between 2000 and 2015.


## Tools used
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. Tableu

## Problem Statements
> The study aims to uncover key relationships between LIFE EXPECTANCY AND A VARIETY OF FACTORS. This includes examining the connections between life expectancy and important HEALTH INDICATORS, ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS implemented around the world.

## Adult Mortality and Life Expectancy
> A strong negative correlation (-0.60) exists between life expectancy and adult mortality. Lower adult mortality rates lead to increased life expectancy.


## Impact of Vaccination on Life Expectancy
> Both Hepatitis B and Polio vaccination coverage demonstrate moderate positive correlations with life expectancy.
> The findings emphasize the importance of vaccination programs in public health initiatives, especially for Polio, due to its significant positive correlation with life expectancy.
> The nearly perfect correlation between infant and under-five death rates suggests a strong interlinkage.

## Economic Impact on Life Expectancy
> A strong positive correlation (0.840424) exists between life expectancy and GDP.
> A negative relationship between expenditure and adult mortality.

## Time Based Analysis of Life Expectancy
> In recent years, healthcare spending has stabilized around 250-300%, indicating a balance between cost containment and service delivery.

## Social Factors Analysis
> Strong positive correlation between education and life expectancy
> Higher alcohol consumption generally correlates with increased mortality

## Development Indicators
> Top 5 countries with life expectancy around 80 years or higher
1. Japan
2. Sweden
3. Iceland
4. Switzerland
5. France
> Countries with worst health outcomes:
1. Cook Islands
2. Dominica
3. Marshall Islands
4. Monaco
5. Nauru

## Public Health Outcomes: A Multifaceted Analysis
> Hepatitis B and Polio vaccination coverage show moderate positive correlations with life expectancy.
> For developing nations, focusing on both economic growth and efficient healthcare spending might be more effective than just increasing health expenditure.
